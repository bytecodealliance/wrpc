## About

wRPC facilitates execution of arbitrary functionality defined in [WIT] over network or other means of communication.

Main use cases for wRPC are:
- out-of-tree WebAssembly runtime plugins
- distributed WebAssembly component communication

Even though wRPC is designed for Wasm components first and foremost, it is fully usable outside of WebAssembly context and can serve as a general-purpose RPC framework.

wRPC uses [component model value definiton encoding] on the wire.

wRPC supports both dynamic (based on e.g. runtime WebAssembly component type introspection) and static use cases.

For static use cases, wRPC provides [WIT] binding generators for:
- Rust
- Go

wRPC fully supports the unreleased native [WIT] `stream` and `future` data types along with all currently released WIT functionality.

## Quickstart

wRPC usage examples for different programming languages can be found at [examples](./examples).

There are 2 different kinds of examples:
- Native wRPC applications, tied to a particular wRPC transport (currently, NATS only)
- Generic Wasm components, that need to run in a Wasm runtime. Those can be executed, for example, using `wrpc-wasmtime-nats`, to polyfill imports at runtime and serve exports using wRPC.

### `hello` example

In this example we will serve and invoke a simple [`hello`](./examples/wit/hello/hello.wit) application using:

- [examples/rust/hello-component-client](examples/rust/hello-component-client)
- [examples/rust/hello-component-server](examples/rust/hello-component-server)
- [examples/rust/hello-nats-client](examples/rust/hello-nats-client)
- [examples/rust/hello-nats-server](examples/rust/hello-nats-server)

#### Requirements

- `nats-server` >= 2.10.20 or `docker` >= 24.0.6 (or any other OCI runtime)
- `rust` >= 1.80.1

#### How-To

In the steps below, `wasm32-wasip1` target will be used, because it is currently available in stable Rust and also conveniently configured in [`rust-toolchain.toml`](./rust-toolchain.toml) in the root of this repository.

[`wasm32-wasip2`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support/wasm32-wasip2.html) can be used instead, if desired.

1. Build Wasm `hello` client:

    ```sh
    cargo build --release -p hello-component-client --target wasm32-wasip1
    ```

    > Output is in target/wasm32-wasip1/release/hello-component-client.wasm

2. Build Wasm `hello` server:

    ```sh
    cargo build --release -p hello-component-server --target wasm32-wasip1
    ```
    
    > Output is in target/wasm32-wasip1/release/hello_component_server.wasm

    > NB: Rust uses `_` separators in the filename, because a component is built as a reactor-style library

3. Build the wRPC Wasm runtime:
    
    ```sh
    cargo build --release --bin wrpc-wasmtime-nats
    ```

    > Output is in target/release/wrpc-wasmtime-nats or target/release/wrpc-wasmtime-nats.exe on Windows

4. Run NATS (more thorough documentation available [here](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/introduction/running)):

    - using standalone binary:
    ```sh
    nats-server
    ```
    
    - using Docker:
    ```sh
    docker run --rm -it --name nats-server -p 4222:4222 nats:2.10.20-alpine3.20
    ```

5. Serve Wasm `hello` server via NATS:

    ```sh
    ./target/release/wrpc-wasmtime-nats serve rust rust ./target/wasm32-wasip1/release/hello_component_server.wasm
    ```
    
    - Sample output:
    > INFO async_nats: event: connected
    >
    > INFO wrpc_wasmtime_nats_cli: serving instance function name="hello"

6. Call Wasm `hello` server using a Wasm `hello` client via NATS:

    ```sh
    ./target/release/wrpc-wasmtime-nats run rust ./target/wasm32-wasip1/release/hello-component-client.wasm
    ```
    
    - Sample output in the client:
    > INFO async_nats: event: connected
    >
    >hello from Rust
    
    - Sample output in the server:
    > INFO wrpc_wasmtime_nats_cli: serving instance function invocation headers=None
    >
    > INFO wrpc_wasmtime_nats_cli: successfully served instance function invocation

7. Call the Wasm `hello` server using a native wRPC `hello` client:

    ```sh
    cargo run -p hello-nats-client rust
    ```

8. Serve native wRPC `hello` server:

    ```sh
    cargo run -p hello-nats-server native
    ```

9. Call both the native wRPC `hello` server and Wasm `hello` server using native wRPC `hello` client:

    ```sh
    cargo run -p hello-nats-client rust native
    ```

10. Call native wRPC `hello` server using Wasm `hello` client via NATS:

    ```sh
    ./target/release/wrpc-wasmtime-nats run native ./target/wasm32-wasip1/release/hello-component-client.wasm
    ```

## Design

### Transport

wRPC transport is the core abstraction on top of which all the other functionality is built.

A transport represents a multiplexed bidirectional communication channel, over which wRPC invocations are transmitted.

wRPC operates under assumption that transport communication channels can be "indexed" by a sequence of unsigned 32-bit integers, which represent a reflective structural path.

### Invocation

As part of every wRPC invocation at least 2 independent, directional byte streams will be established by the chosen transport:

- parameters (client -> server)
- results (server -> client)

wRPC transport implementations MAY (and are encouraged to) provide two more directional communication channels:

- client error (client -> server)
- server error (server -> client)

Error channels are the only channels that are *typed*, in particular, values sent on these channels are *strings*.

If `async` values are being transmitted as parameters or results of an invocation, wRPC MAY send those values on an indexed path asynchronously.

Consider the invocation of [WIT] function `foo` from instance `wrpc-example:doc/example@0.1.0`:

```wit
package wrpc-example:doc@0.1.0;

interface example {
    record rec {
        a: stream<u8>,
        b: u32,
    }

    foo: func(v: rec) -> stream<u8>;
}
```

1. Since `foo` parameter `0` is a `record`, which contains an `async` type (`stream`) as the first field, wRPC will communicate to the transport that apart from the "root" parameter channel, it may need to receive results at index path `0` (first return value).
2. wRPC will encode the parameters as a single-element tuple in a non-blocking fashion. If full contents of `rec.a` are not available at the time of encoding, the stream will be encoded as `option::none`.
5. (concurrently, if in `2.` stream was not fully available) wRPC will transfer the contents of the `stream<u8>` on parameter byte stream at index `0->0` (first field of the record, which is the first parameter) as they become available.
4. wRPC will attempt to decode `stream<u8>` from the "root" result byte stream.
5. (if `4.` decoded an `option::none` for the `stream` value) wRPC will attempt to decode `stream<u8>` from result byte stream at index `0`

Note, that the *handler* of `foo` (server) MAY:
- receive `rec.b` value before `rec.a` is sent or even available
- send a result back to the *invoker* of `foo` (client) *before* it has received `rec.a`

## Repository structure

This repository contains (for all supported languages):
- core libraries and abstractions
- binding generators
- WebAssembly runtime integrations
- wRPC transport implementations

`wit-bindgen-wrpc` aims to closely match UX of [`wit-bindgen`] and therefore includes a subtree merge of the project, which is occasionally merged into this tree.
- wRPC binding generators among other tests, are tested using the [`wit-bindgen`] test suite
- [`wit-bindgen`] documentation is reused where applicable
