/// A keyvalue interface that provides atomic operations.

/// Atomic operations are single, indivisible operations. When a fault causes an atomic operation to
/// fail, it will appear to the invoker of the atomic operation that the action either completed
/// successfully or did nothing at all.
/// 
/// Please note that this interface is bare functions that take a reference to a bucket. This is to
/// get around the current lack of a way to "extend" a resource with additional methods inside of
/// wit. Future version of the interface will instead extend these methods on the base `bucket`
/// resource.
